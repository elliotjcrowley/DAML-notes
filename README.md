# DAML4 notes

This git repo contains the notes that accompany the lecture for DAML4. These take the form of Jupyter notebooks. Students ran these on a university server where all the required packages were pre-installed but the big ones to make sure you have installed are pandas, sklearn, pytorch, and skorch.
