# DAML4 notes

This git repo contains the notes that accompany the lecture for DAML4. These take the form of Jupyter notebooks.

I recommend running these on [Notable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login) because (i) you don't have to set up your own local Jupyter environment, (ii) all the packages you'll need for the labs are already installed.

## Instructions for cloning this repo to Notable

1. Log into Notable from https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login
2. Start a **Language and Machine Learning** server
3. Click the +GitRepo button in the top right corner
4. Enter the details below and click Clone.
    - Git Repository URL: https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/DAML4/notes.git
    - Branch: main
    - Username: **YOUR UUN**
    - Password: **YOUR PASSWORD**

This will create a directory called `notes.git` which contains the notebooks for each week.
