# DAML4 notes

This git repo contains the notes that accompany the lecture for DAML4. These take the form of Jupyter notebooks.

I recommend running these on [Notable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login) because (i) you don't have to set up your own local Jupyter environment, (ii) all the packages you'll need for the labs are already installed.

## Instructions for cloning this repo to Notable

1. Log into Notable from https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login
2. Start a **Language and Machine Learning** server
3. Click the "New" button iin the top right corner, then click "Terminal". This will create a new tab with a terminal in it.
4. In the terminal:
    - Enter `export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1` (a non-ideal hack to get this working)
    - Enter `git clone https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/DAML4/notes.git`
    - Then enter your UUN 
    - Then enter your password (when you type this, no symbols will show as a security measure).

This will create a directory called `notes` which contains the notebooks for each week.
